# Basics_I_Guess
Basic programs to identify concepts/ideas and to help learning become practical. I'm new to this stuff so any criticism or suggestions would be great.
Anything learned throughout my study of programming will be illustrated on github because I know how challenging this journey can be and I want to be a contributor to others learning such an important skill.
If there is anything you believe to belong to anybody else then please say so, I am doing this purely for learning myself and incorporating practicality into learning.
Strong criticism and suggestions for improvements are always welcome.
